##CODEBOOK DESCRIPTION

This document is a codebook that provides descriptions of the variables, the data, and all transformations and work that I performed to clean up the data.

##The Data Source

Source data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Description of the dataset from the source website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##The dataset

The dataset includes the following files (some of which are currently too large to upload to this Github repository):
  
  'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

##The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

##TRANSFORMATIONS:

In run_analysis.R:

##Variable units:

Activity variable is factor type. Subject variable is integer type. All the other variables are numeric type.
